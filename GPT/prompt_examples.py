For the film , the maxima absorption spectra of PQCDTB and PCZDTB were red - shifted by 9-23 nm compared with the solution.

In the case of PQCDTB , unlike the PQA2T ( poly[quinacridone-bithiophene] ) reported by Takimiya et al. , a clear oxidation - reduction peak was observed. 19 This type of result has been obtained because PQCDTB was D-A structured , unlike the typical p - type structure of PQA2T.
